# BestBooks

### A book tracker, reviewer, and  organizer

**What is BestBooks?**

BestBooks is an application that allows users to

- *keep track* of their library via adding previously-read books to their collection while including important
  information like book genre, author, title, and more.
- *review* books by adding personal ratings (out of 5 stars).
- *remove* books from their library

**Who should use BestBooks?**

- BestBooks is for any voracious readers who have too many books to keep track of, and anyone who wants to read!

**Why was BestBooks created?**

- I've always been a big reader ever since I was a kid, so keeping track of the books I've read can be a little
  difficult. I figured that creating something to help my (admittedly poor) memory would be useful for myself and any
  other book-lovers!
