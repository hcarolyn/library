# BestBooks

### A book tracker, reviewer, and  organizer

**What is BestBooks?**

BestBooks is an application that allows users to 
- *keep track* of their library via adding previously-read books to their collection while including important 
information like book genre, author, title, and more. 
- *review* books by adding personal ratings (out of 5 stars) and express interest via adding books to their 
*to-read* list.
- *remove* books from their *to-read* list or library
- *search* for books in their library based on information such as the book title, genre, author, or review.

**Who should use BestBooks?**
- BestBooks is for any voracious readers who have too many books to keep track of, and anyone who wants
to read!

**Why was BestBooks created?**
- I've always been a big reader ever since I was a kid, so keeping track of the books I've read can be a little 
difficult. I figured that creating something to help my (admittedly poor) memory would be useful for 
myself and any other book-lovers!
